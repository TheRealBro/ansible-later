This is a fork of Will Thames [ansible-review](https://github.com/willthames/ansible-review) so credits goes to him
for his work on ansible-review and ansible-lint.

*ansible-later* is a best pratice scanner and linting tool. In most cases, if you write ansibel roles in a team,
it helps to have a coding or best practice guideline in place. This will make ansible roles more readable for all
maintainers and can reduce the troubleshooting time.

*ansible-later* does _**not**_ ensure that your role will work as expected. For Deployment test you can use other tools
like [molecule](https://github.com/ansible/molecule).

The project name is an acronym for **L**ovely **A**utomation **TE**sting f**R**mework.
